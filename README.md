# Solar PV Forecasting System for Trading
_Datathon 2024_
Solar photovoltaic (PV) forecasting system enabling renewable energy producers to optimize day-ahead trading.

Developed a solar photovoltaic (PV) forecasting system enabling renewable energy producers to optimize day-ahead trading. The project consisted of data collection from external API,feature selection, model design, training and forecasting. Utilized relevant data such as historical prices, weather conditions, and other indicators by leveraging an encoder-decoder LSTM RNN (ED-LSTM) model. The model was succesfully capable of predicting the next-day PV production as measured by Profit and Loss (PnL) - on picture below.
